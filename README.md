<h1>Quasar Simulation</h1>


<p1>simple quasar simulation made with unreal engine 5, niagara</p1>

The particle system is running fully on the CPU, could serve
as an excellent benchmark. (reaches the limit of 2.7 million instances defined by the engine)
Uses Vulkan as the renderer.
FPS counter added.

Made Using Niagara inside, Unreal Engine (v5.3.2)

The simulation itself:

This simulation is only representative and does not represent the 
actual physics of a living quasar.

Altough, I made it so it has the following to approximate reality within
the possibilities Niagara and Unreal can offer:

- two "Gas" accretion disks, one is of 580-650 (nm WaveLegnth) the other is of "cooler" gas in the 500's.
  both accretion disks are spiral shaped and orbit around one "singularity" in the center of undefined mass. The subject accretion disks both have spiral shapes
  and previously defined different revolution speed around the center.
  I took care to add two quasar jets to simulate the magnetic field breaking points at the poles.

  <p2>feel free to use for anything</p2>
  sad i did not implement gravitational length distortion.
  will do it later..
